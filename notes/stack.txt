Stack
-> Stack is a linear data structure and where the elements could be added or deleted at one open end called the top of the stack.
-> that means we cannot add any element anywhere of the stack or delete an element from anywhere.
-> It is only the top end where an element could be added or deleted in stack.
-> In stack the element follows 'Last In First Out Order' typically called 'LIFO'.
-> i.e. The element added first will be deleted last and the element add last will be deleted first.
-> Insertion into the stack is called 'push' operation.
-> Deletion from the stack is called 'pop' operation.
-> That means if we need to add an element into the stack we need to call the push operation.
-> and if we want to delete the top element then we need to call the pop operation.
-> If the stack is full, then it is said to be in 'Overflow' state and push is rejected if stack is overflow.
-> If the stack is empty, then it is said to be in 'Underflow' state and pop is rejected if stack is underflow.
